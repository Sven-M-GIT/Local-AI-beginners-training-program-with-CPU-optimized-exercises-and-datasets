# Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("../datasets/titanic.csv")

# Preprocess
df["Sex"] = df["Sex"].map({"male": 0, "female": 1})
X = df[["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare"]]
y = df["Survived"]

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))

### Exercises:
- Add more features (e.g., family size).
- Handle missing values.
- Analyze feature importance.
